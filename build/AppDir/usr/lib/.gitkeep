Put all 'build/Release/src/app/enve' dependencies into this folder.

Example:
First make sure you copied 'build/Release/src/app/enve' into 'build/AppDir/usr/bin'.

Open terminal in 'build/AppDir/usr' and execute:
ldd bin/enve
Make sure no dependencies are missing, by checking for 'not found'.

Open terminal in 'build/AppDir/usr' and execute:
ldd bin/enve | grep "=> /" | awk '{print $3}' | xargs -I '{}' cp -v '{}' lib/
Now all dependecies should be in 'build/AppDir/usr/lib' folder.
